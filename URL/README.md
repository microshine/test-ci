# STIR/SHAKEN Certificate Repository Compliance

Participants in the STIR/SHAKEN ecosystem are required to publish the certificates they use for signing calls so that other participants can retrieve these certificates and use them for validating signatures.

To ease meeting this requirement many of the certificate authorities publish the certificates for their customers and the majority of the STIR/SHAKEN deployments use these CA-provided repositories. There are still some cases where customers choose to host the certificate on their own.

This report looks at what errors and compliance issues relying parties may experience when trying to use these certificate repositories.
